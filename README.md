# Leptos-Todo
A TODO web app built on [leptos](https://github.com/leptos-rs/leptos/), a frontend framework written in pure rust.  
Most of the implementation referred
[the TodoMVC example](https://github.com/leptos-rs/leptos/tree/main/examples/todomvc)
on leptos github, though some designs are original.

Filtering and deleting items is not available yet.
